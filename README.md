# Machine-Learning-_-Classification-in-Python
We will be using the Parkinson's data set composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson’s disease
The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to “status” column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD. 
- In this assgnment we will propose a software solution to the practical problem using machine learning.
- We will run different ML models on this dataset in order to determine which is the most accurate model.
